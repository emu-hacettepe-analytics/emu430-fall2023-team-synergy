# Tidy Data

[DATA](library_museum.RData)

# General Information About Data

Data are published nationally and according to IBBS (İstatistiki Bölge Birimleri Sınıflandırması) Level 3. There is detailed information about museums and public libraries. In general, museum statistics include the number of museums, the number of works in museums and the number of visitors. Likewise, library statistics include the number of public libraries and the number of books and users of these libraries.

# Reason to Choose This Data Set

By selecting this data set, our study aims to access the number of existing libraries and museums in different cities. Simultaneously, we intend to analyze the proportional usage of these locations, enabling us to draw conclusions on a city-by-city basis. Our goal is to compare demand versus availability, identify discrepancies, and pinpoint areas with insufficient cultural institutions. This analysis will facilitate the evaluation of library and museum distribution across cities,highlighting areas that may need further development.
