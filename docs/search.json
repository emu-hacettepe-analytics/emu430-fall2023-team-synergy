This is our project webpage.\nPlease stay tuned to follow our project activities.\n\nTeam Members\n\nBeyza Göktaş\nEmre Gül\nHatice Nur Güneş\nKerem Kaplan\nOsman Bolat\n\n\n\nProject Topic\nIn our project, we will use a data set containing statistics of museums and libraries in different cities of Turkey. This data set includes values such as the number of libraries in the cities, the number of museums, the number of people registered in the library, and the number of visitors in museums. Thanks to these rich data sets, it is possible to obtain important values such as the average number of visitors and the number of books.\nIn addition, by working on the cultural values of cities according to years, average, maximum, etc. we can determine the values. These analyzes will help us understand the use of cultural institutions in each city and the balances between demand and provision. The results will guide us in determining the demands for cultural services, identifying deficiencies and highlighting areas that require further development.\n\n\nData Set\nData source: Türkiye Library and Museum Statistics\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "General Information About Data\nData are published nationally and according to IBBS (İstatistiki Bölge Birimleri Sınıflandırması) Level 3. There is detailed information about museums and public libraries. In general, museum statistics include the number of museums, the number of works in museums and the number of visitors. Likewise, library statistics include the number of public libraries and the number of books and users of these libraries.\n\n\nReason to Choose This Data Set\nBy selecting this data set, our study aims to access the number of existing libraries and museums in different cities. Simultaneously, we intend to analyze the proportional usage of these locations, enabling us to draw conclusions on a city-by-city basis. Our goal is to compare demand versus availability, identify discrepancies, and pinpoint areas with insufficient cultural institutions. This analysis will facilitate the evaluation of library and museum distribution across cities,highlighting areas that may need further development.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
